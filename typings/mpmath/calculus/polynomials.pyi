def polyroots(ctx, coeffs, maxsteps=..., cleanup=..., extraprec=..., error=..., roots_init=...): # -> list[Any] | tuple[list[Any], Any]:
    """
    Computes all roots (real or complex) of a given polynomial.

    The roots are returned as a sorted list, where real roots appear first
    followed by complex conjugate roots as adjacent elements. The polynomial
    should be given as a list of coefficients, in the format used by
    :func:`~mpmath.polyval`. The leading coefficient must be nonzero.

    With *error=True*, :func:`~mpmath.polyroots` returns a tuple *(roots, err)*
    where *err* is an estimate of the maximum error among the computed roots.

    **Examples**

    Finding the three real roots of `x^3 - x^2 - 14x + 24`::

        >>> from mpmath import *
        >>> mp.dps = 15; mp.pretty = True
        >>> nprint(polyroots([1,-1,-14,24]), 4)
        [-4.0, 2.0, 3.0]

    Finding the two complex conjugate roots of `4x^2 + 3x + 2`, with an
    error estimate::

        >>> roots, err = polyroots([4,3,2], error=True)
        >>> for r in roots:
        ...     print(r)
        ...
        (-0.375 + 0.59947894041409j)
        (-0.375 - 0.59947894041409j)
        >>>
        >>> err
        2.22044604925031e-16
        >>>
        >>> polyval([4,3,2], roots[0])
        (2.22044604925031e-16 + 0.0j)
        >>> polyval([4,3,2], roots[1])
        (2.22044604925031e-16 + 0.0j)

    The following example computes all the 5th roots of unity; that is,
    the roots of `x^5 - 1`::

        >>> mp.dps = 20
        >>> for r in polyroots([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1]):
        ...     print(r)
        ...
        1.0
        (-0.8090169943749474241 + 0.58778525229247312917j)
        (-0.8090169943749474241 - 0.58778525229247312917j)
        (0.3090169943749474241 + 0.95105651629515357212j)
        (0.3090169943749474241 - 0.95105651629515357212j)

    **Precision and conditioning**

    The roots are computed to the current working precision accuracy. If this
    accuracy cannot be achieved in ``maxsteps`` steps, then a
    ``NoConvergence`` exception is raised. The algorithm internally is using
    the current working precision extended by ``extraprec``. If
    ``NoConvergence`` was raised, that is caused either by not having enough
    extra precision to achieve convergence (in which case increasing
    ``extraprec`` should fix the problem) or too low ``maxsteps`` (in which
    case increasing ``maxsteps`` should fix the problem), or a combination of
    both.

    The user should always do a convergence study with regards to
    ``extraprec`` to ensure accurate results. It is possible to get
    convergence to a wrong answer with too low ``extraprec``.

    Provided there are no repeated roots, :func:`~mpmath.polyroots` can
    typically compute all roots of an arbitrary polynomial to high precision::

        >>> mp.dps = 60
        >>> for r in polyroots([1, 0, -10, 0, 1]):
        ...     print(r)

    **Algorithm**

    :func:`~mpmath.polyroots` implements the Durand-Kerner method [1], which
    uses complex arithmetic to locate all roots simultaneously.
    The Durand-Kerner method can be viewed as approximately performing
    simultaneous Newton iteration for all the roots. In particular,
    the convergence to simple roots is quadratic, just like Newton's
    method.

    Although all roots are internally calculated using complex arithmetic, any
    root found to have an imaginary part smaller than the estimated numerical
    error is truncated to a real number (small real parts are also chopped).
    Real roots are placed first in the returned list, sorted by value. The
    remaining complex roots are sorted by their real parts so that conjugate
    roots end up next to each other.
