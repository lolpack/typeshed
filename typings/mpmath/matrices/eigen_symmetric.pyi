    This routine transforms a real symmetric matrix A to a real symmetric
    tridiagonal matrix T using an orthogonal similarity transformation:
          Q' * A * Q = T     (here ' denotes the matrix transpose).
    The orthogonal matrix Q is build up from Householder reflectors.

    parameters:
      A         (input/output) On input, A contains the real symmetric matrix of
                dimension (n,n). On output, if calc_ev is true, A contains the
                orthogonal matrix Q, otherwise A is destroyed.

      D         (output) real array of length n, contains the diagonal elements
                of the tridiagonal matrix

      E         (output) real array of length n, contains the offdiagonal elements
                of the tridiagonal matrix in E[0:(n-1)] where is the dimension of
                the matrix A. E[n-1] is undefined.

      calc_ev   (input) If calc_ev is true, this routine explicitly calculates the
                orthogonal matrix Q which is then returned in A. If calc_ev is
                false, Q is not explicitly calculated resulting in a shorter run time.

               matrix U; otherwise A is simply used as workspace and thus destroyed.

      V        (input/output) if false, the matrix V is not calculated. otherwise
               V must be a matrix of shape n*n.

      calc_u   (input) If true, the matrix U is calculated and replaces A.
